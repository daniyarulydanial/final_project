# The Team: 
Daniaryuly Daniyal, Pirniyazov Miras, Baktibayev Daulet

# Roles: 
- Daniyaruly Danial: Data analysis and data preparation
- Pirniyazov Miras: Modelling: model selection and tuning
- Baktibayev Daulet: Evaluation and deployment: model interpretation and launching the model as a service

There you can make a single prediction and get results as a zip file with SHAP explanation visuals and the decision themselves.

Or you can upload a whole file (test file with no flags is in github repository), and the result is a zip file with CSV file with predictions and decisions and different SHAP visuals which explain how model did come to its predictions.
